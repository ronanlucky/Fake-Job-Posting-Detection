This research addresses the critical challenge of identifying fake job advertisements in online recruitment platforms, achieving **85% accuracy** through ensemble methods and advanced data balancing techniques.

## 📊 Key Results

### Model Performance Comparison
| Algorithm | Accuracy | Recall (Fake) | F1-Score (Fake) |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Random Forest + SMOTE | 98% | 68% | 0.80 |
| Gradient Boosting | 97% | 97% | 0.73 |
| XGBoost | 97% | 77% | 0.70 |
