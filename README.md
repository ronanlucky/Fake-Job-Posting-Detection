# Fake-job-posting-detection
Detection fake job postings using Machine learning and Natural Language processing. To increase the efficency of the model boosting algorithms are used. Publicly available dataset which is EMSCAD is used as source. To balance the dissimilarities in the data sampling techniques which include SMOTE and ADASYN are performed.

** Abstract**
While many organizations these days prefer to post their job opportunities
on the web so that job seekers can access them conveniently and easily, this
practice might be an example of scam from the side of swindlers who offer job
hunters tasks and services in exchange for money. Many people fall victims to
this type of fraud and lose a considerable amount of money as a result. The
proposed approach uses a variety of machine learning algorithms inclusive of
supervised learning tools and natural language processing methods to analyze
and sort job advertisements. By using both single classifiers and ensemble
classifiers, the system assess results and compare them, thus recognizing
fraudulent job advertisements on the Internet. Model performance will be
evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This
study aims to demonstrate the potential of boosting techniques for achieving
high accuracy in fake job posts prediction, potentially leading to improved
outcomes
Therefore, the value of the research in helping to create a more secure
online job market can serves to establish a level of trust for job seekers and
provides them with protection from the financial and emotional risks related
to the misuse of deceptive job postings
